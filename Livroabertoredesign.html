<p>
                    Between life and death there is a library, and within that library, the shelves go on forever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices... Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?
                  </p>
<p>
                    Nora Seed finds herself faced with this decision. Faced with the possibility of changing her life for a new one, following a different career, undoing old breakups, realizing her dreams of becoming a glaciologist; she must search within herself as she travels through the Midnight Library to decide what is truly fulfilling in life, and what makes it worth living in the first place.
                  </p>
<p>
                    The clock tower in the small town of Bedford struck midnight. Nora Seed was in the library. She wasn’t supposed to be there. The library was closed. But Nora wasn’t a regular visitor. She was there for a very specific reason. The shelves stretched into darkness, lined with books of every color and size. Each one was a life she could have lived. A life where she hadn't given up swimming. A life where she had stayed in the band with her brother. A life where she had moved to Australia with her best friend.
                  </p>
<p>
                    She walked past the endless aisles, her fingers lightly brushing against the spines of the books. Each one held a universe of possibilities. Her guide, the librarian, Mrs. Elm, had explained the rules. She could choose any book, live that life, and if she found a life she wanted to stay in, she could. But if she was disappointed, she would be pulled back to the library, to choose again. The only risk was that the library itself was not permanent. It existed for as long as she remained between life and death. If the library collapsed while she was inside it, she would die.
                  </p>
<p>
                    "Where do I start?" she asked, her voice a whisper in the silent expanse.
                  </p>
<p>
                    Mrs. Elm smiled, her eyes twinkling. "With your regrets, my dear. The biggest ones first."
